### Hey there...

Thanks for the email! I promise to get back to you as soon as possible, just be aware that I might not reply right away. If you need to get in touch with me immediately send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/bitflying "my twitter profile").

 While you're waiting why not check out my drive through Arches National Park a few years back with my good buddy Garrick Chow. We took a week and drove across country including some of the spots I had always wanted to see along the way. Arches was definitely one of the high points of my trip. If you have never been there I highly recommend it, pictures and even this video don't begin to do it justice.
